Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Title: Model Study on "WeChat Lucky Money" with Monte Carlo Simulation

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)
Every year on New Year's Eve, accompanied by the festive atmosphere of the New Year, the enthusiasm of the public to send and receive "WeChat Red Packet" also reached a climax.
According to statistics, on the eve of 2014, the total number of WeChat red packets received and dispatched was 16 million; in 2015, it exceeded 1 billion on New Year's Eve; 8.08 million in 2016 New Year?s Eve and 13.2 billion in 2017 New Year?s Eve.
Our group's purpose is to implement Monte Carlo Simulation for the model of "Wechat lucky money relay", which rule is that  In one Wechat group, one person send an electronic red envelope first with random money amount and packet numbers, then everyone started to grab. The person who grab the largest amount of money continued to send a new round of red envelopes and then continued to reciprocate.
Through the simulation results and analysis to research how different relay methods and game environments affect the redistribution of wealth among members of the Wechat group.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
1. Total amount of red envelope
2. The packets number of Each envelope.
3. The number of group member
4. The initial amount of each person

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:


## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
