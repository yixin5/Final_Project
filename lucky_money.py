"""
Our group's purpose is to implement Monte Carlo Simulation for the model of "Wechat lucky money relay", which rule
is that In one Wechat group, one person send an electronic red envelope first with random money amount and packet
numbers, then everyone started to grab. The person who grab the largest amount of money continued to send a new round
of red envelopes and then continued to reciprocate. Through the simulation results and analysis to research how different
relay methods and game environments affect the redistribution of wealth among members of the Wechat group.

The numpy version we used in this project is 1.14.2.
